    <h1> About me</h1>

    Hello! I'm currently a software engineer at a data science company called <a
        href="https://www.quantco.com/">QuantCo</a>.</br> </br>
    
    You can find out more about me on my <a href="https://github.com/adityagoel4512">GitHub</a> or <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityagoel4512/">LinkedIn</a>.

    </ul>

    Prior to QuantCo, I spent a brief time at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms">Meta</a>.
    I also interned at <a href="https://www.gresearch.com/">G-Research</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings">Arm</a>.
    </br></br>

    

    I played some county level cricket as a teenager and enjoyed playing with the ICUCC during my time at university. I
    am now a casual enthusiast of running and bouldering.
