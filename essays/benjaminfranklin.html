<h1>Ben Franklin</h1>
The American founding fathers were truly remarkable people, Ben Franklin perhaps most so.

At the age of 20 he came up with these 13 virtues to live by - I think they are pretty wise:

<ul>
    <li>Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
    <li>Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
    <li>Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
    <li>Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
    <li>Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.
    <li>Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
    <li>Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
    <li>Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
    <li>Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
    <li>Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.
    <li>Tranquility. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
    <li>Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.
    <li>Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
</ul>
