    So I turned 25. I probably don't reflect nearly enough as I should, but this time I really did. Something about the number felt significant.

    Some things I'll be changing:
    <ul>
        <li>Taking more risk. I've definitely underexposed myself to risk, personal or financial in the last few years. I got into the completely wrong mindset. Hope it's not too late, but I'll be taking some wilder bets.</li>
        <li>Being more observant and building a tolerance for quietness. I view commutes as a waste of time and rush to move from place to place as fast as possible. I operate primarily on instinct, experiments and System 1 type thinking. Thinking things through deeply and slowly is something I avoid more than I should as it forces you to slow down and shut everything out (I don't like this). How can I be fast and pragmatic but also slow and methodical when necessary? Probably no more IG reels.</li>
        <li>Understanding discipline and my own brain. I have the most hope for this one. Simply staying on the treadmill for an hour, with no music or entertainment, was some kind of medieval torture to me but I'm slowly fixing my baseline dopamine levels. Did it twice this week!</li>
        <li>Become a London/NYC 10.</li>
    </ul>
    
    I should probably move country too for a while. I've been in London for far too long. It'd probably be best if it was an anglo country - USA ftw (I'll write code)?
