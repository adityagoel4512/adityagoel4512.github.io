    So I turned 25. I probably don't reflect nearly enough as I should, but this time I really did. Something about the number felt significant.

    Some things I'll be changing:
    <ul>
        <li>Taking more risk. I've definitely underexposed myself to risk, and got into the wrong mindset. I'll be taking some wilder bets.</li>
        <li>Being more observant. I operate primarily instinctively in my life and through experimentation and System 1 type thinking. Thinking things through deeply and slowly is a superpower; it forces you to slow down and shut everything out (which I don't like) and solve problems <i>better</i> in the long run. How can I be fast and pragmatic but also slow and methodical when necessary?</li>
        <li>Discipline and my own brain. I have the most hope for this one. Running without headphones, as innocuous as it seems, is genuinely challenging for me.</li>
        <li>Become a London/NYC 10. Third Space, Steak & Pilates.</li>
    </ul>
    
    I should probably move country too for a while. I've been in London for far too long. It'd probably be best if it was an anglo country - USA ftw (I'll write code)?
