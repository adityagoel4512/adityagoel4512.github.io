    <h1>The two kinds of software engineer</h1>

    I've realized that there are two rough clusters of engineers I've encountered, and understanding this it important to rationalize <i>why</i> different people are receptive to different kinds of arguments and what makes them tick.

    <h2>The artisan</h2>
    To this engineer, the code they write is itself the end, not a means to some other outcome.
    <br/><br/>
    The fact that the software the artisan develops must sold or that there is a broader mission is just a economic reality for this engineer - it in its own right provides no motivation.
    If you could design and develop high quality software with the right principles without needing to sell it, well that would be great and not detract from the experience.
    <br/><br/>
    These engineers care deeply about <i>how</i> you engineer just as much as <i>what</i> you produce. 
    In broader organizations, these personalities are essential to maintain long-term vision and high standards in a code base. Over time, bad decisions bring speed to a grinding halt and taking a bit more time up front can be immeasurably valuable.
    <br/><br/>
    In smaller startups where shipping fast and focussing on your user is essential to survive, I suspect it might be a challenge for the artisan, unless there is consensus on what is "good".
    The unfortunate thing about having lots of people with intense opinions, strongly held is that if the opinions are incompatible then nothing gets done.
    <br/><br/>
    In a startup where you quickly want to ship and having the "incorrect answer" is worse than "doing nothing", this is untenable. You need pragmatic "merchants" who aren't afraid to break a few things to reach an outcome and for whom a right or wrong decision is not a binary outcome.

    <h2>The merchant/technical entrepreneur</h2>

    The code is a means to an end for these people. Quality is important to the extent that it satisfies the user, and the code has as much value as the economic value it generates. 

    I recently listened to a podcast by some YC folks (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/ME-vibe-coding-is-the-future#:~:text=Andrej%20Karpathy%20recently%20coined%20the,changing%20how%20products%20are%20built.">Vibe Coding is the Future</a>) on the subject of vibe coding.
    I suspect opinons on "vibe coding" are a surrogate measure for how much of an "artisan" or a "merchant" you are.

    Some main takeaways that <i>they think</i> is true. Emphasis on the <i>they</i> because we should keep their bias as folks building companies in mind: 
    <ul>
        <li>Using AI assistants and code generation tools is a no-brainer for going from "zero-to-one".</li>
        <li>Latest YC startups are generating 90% of their code using AI assistants.</li>
        <li>Going from "one-to-N" is still hard and requires traditional, "hardcore" engineering skills.</li>
        <li>Code has never been cheaper. You can rewrite more regularly.</li>
    </ul> 

    These folks have a perspective that resonates strongly with the kind of person that sees coding as a <i>means to an end</i> - they want to build a business, and writing software happens to be a great way to solve the problem their business is tackling.
    If you could solve the problem without programming, you would!
    
    <br/><br/>
    I think these personalities are clearly essential in small companies. Without a viable business or happy customers, nothing follows.
    On the other hand, you see "artisans" begin to dominate at very large companies because business problems become bottlenecked by more challenging technical ones.
    The "artisan" can be well-suited here since they can take a long-term view and the cost of taking time to make a better decision is much smaller; Instagram will still generate revenue if you ship your feature today or by the end of the week, but this time window might be existential for a small company with 1 customer. 
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    I definitely skew towards the second category. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy diving deep on technical projects, but the reason I got into programming in the first place was to build stuff for other people.
    I derive a lot of my motivation from "winning" the business challenge, and would feel little joy in producing a beautiful system with 0 users. That said, having a pure passion for the craft of programming is absolutely essential: sometimes building something that already exists, from scratch, is a great idea to learn something deeply or push the technical boundaries in a way that goes well beyond economic value.
    
    <br/><br/>
    When discussing technical topics and finding no common ground, it really helps to be aware of what is making the other person tick and where they are coming from. I think these two kinds of software engineers often bring very different perspectives to the same problem, and threading the needle that satisfies both the art and the business of it can have the best outcomes over time.
