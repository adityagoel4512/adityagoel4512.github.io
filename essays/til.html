Interaction nets are a model of computation that uses rewrite rules described <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/interaction_nets.html">here</a>.

<ul>
    <li> It is term-based and pure. Simply rewrite terms until you reach a normal form (like lambda calculus).</li>
    <li> Reductions are local and can be done in parallel. </li>
    <li> It is strongly confluent and so the order of reduction does not matter. </li>
</ul>
All of this is cool. Implementing a interaction net evaluator would scale automatically across cores and machines.
People have done some impressive engineering to make this happen <a href="https://gist.github.com/VictorTaelin/77fd5a2a8a4a07e1da6157ebca3c7cf1">in practice</a>.
